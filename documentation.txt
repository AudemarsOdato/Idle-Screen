Here I learn how to use npm and external libraries

First I initialized my project with npm that adds 'package.js' in my project folder
`npm init` `npm init --yes` to skip

Then I installed dayjs for easier formating of the date and time as well as the timezone
`npm i dayjs`

I also learned to link the .min.js files to the html from the node_module files
I used the .extend function to add plugins in my js files by linking the plugin file to
the html file for the .extend function to work

I also installed micromodal to change the timezone as indicated here as an inspiration

But I found it hard to create a modal window is set aside the idea for the future and
I'll try to create my own modal window first to uderstand it deeper, maybe on some past project
So, I uninstalled the micromodal.js using `npm uninstall micromodal --save`

Using external libraries means understanding how to use them

npm commands
`npm init` `npm init --yes`
`npm install --save` `npm i --save`
`npm uninstall`
