# Documentation 

This app is not yet published and still in developement.

The idea of this app comes from https://roadmap.sh/ that provides you with roadmaps of what you should learn to be proficient to a niche like javascript.

This project taught me how to use npm packages like dayjs, how to install packages learn how to use other developers tools and projects.
