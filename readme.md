This app is not yet published and still in developement.

## Version 0.9
- Added dark mode by clicking the time, click date to revert to light mode.

The idea of this app comes from https://roadmap.sh/ that provides you with roadmaps of what you should learn to be proficient to a niche like javascript.

This project taught me how to use npm packages like dayjs, how to install packages learn how to use other developers tools and projects.
